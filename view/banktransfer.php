<h1>Bank Transfer</h1>

<p>You can make a payment for goods directly to our bank.

Banktransfers are an off-line payment method. Banktransfers take longer than on-line payment methods and involve a higher chance of errors, making them less than ideal as a payment method for the Internet. Banktransfers are still used quite often to pay for products and services purchased via the Internet, however, primarily because they are trusted and familiar to consumers.
How do Banktransfers work?
</p>

<p>
In the Banktransfers payment method, purchasers take the initiative. They send their bank an order to transfer an amount from their account to the account of the seller or to the account of a third party authorized to receive the amount on behalf of the seller. The purchaser can make the transfer using home banking software or by filling in a transfer form and submitting it to his or her bank. Many banks also allow their customers to submit this type of payment order by telephone.
